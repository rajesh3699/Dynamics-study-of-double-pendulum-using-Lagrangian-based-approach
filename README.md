# Simulating different snake locomotion such as lateral undulation, sidewinding, etc using knowledge of forward kinematics and DH parameters

The project was aimed to understand snake gaits. Modelling the basic snake kinematic model using DH parameterization and simulate various 
snake locomotion.

# Future work
Simulating with real world conditions like friction, drag, etc.
