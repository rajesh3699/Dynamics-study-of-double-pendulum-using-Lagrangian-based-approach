# Simulating different snake locomotion such as lateral undulation, sidewinding, etc using knowledge of forward kinematics and DH parameters

The project was aimed to understand snake gaits. Modelling the basic snake kinematic model using DH parameterization and simulate various snake locomotion.

# Derivation of dynamics
The derivation of the dynamics is [here](https://github.com/rajesh3699/Dynamics-study-of-double-pendulum-using-Lagrangian-based-approach./blob/master/Snake%20dynamics%20lagrangian%20approach%20(1).pdf)



# Future work
Solving the differential equations using various iterative numerical methods and thereby comparing results by simulating.
